FMCG Industry is the biggest contributor to the packaging plastic waste generated. 
Statistics reveal that –  More than 95% of the total number of biscuits, dried processed food items, and hair care products; and more than 85% of dairy products, baked goods, laundry, and skincare sold in India were packaged in plastic. According to the government reports –India generates 10 MT per year of plastic waste from the FMCG sector
India’s recycling rate is now at 60% against the global average of 20% While these statistics do not align with that of some independent research reports, the bottom line remains that with the growing usage of plastic, it is time that the FMCG companies start putting up efforts to help India achieve its goal to become plastic neutral.
